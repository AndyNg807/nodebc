            <h1>NEW YORK — &#34;Black Panther&#34; has scored one of the best second weekends ever with an estimated $108 million in ticket sales.</h1>
            <p>Studio estimates Sunday say &#34;Black Panther&#34; is still performing as one of the top blockbusters of all time.

            <p>Of those, only &#34;The Force Awakens&#34; had a better second weekend.</p>
            <p>In two weeks of release, &#34;Black Panther&#34; has grossed &#36;400 million domestically and &#36;704 million worldwide.</p>
            <p>Of new releases, faring the best is the Warner Bros. comedy &#34;Game Night,&#34; starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams. It debuted with &#36;16.6 million.</p>
            <p>The well-reviewed sci-fi thriller &#34;Annihilation&#34; opened with $11 million.</p>
