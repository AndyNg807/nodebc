            <p>As night falls on Hogsmeade village, &#34;The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle&#34; shines brightly with an awe-inspiring spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts&#58; Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin and culminates with awesome beams of lights that fan into the night sky.
                The colorful state-of-the-art light display and special effects projection is accompanied by a special musical arrangement created by Academy Award-winning composer John Williams based on his original scores composed for the film series. The musical arrangement that emanates in a surround sound environment was conducted by prolific arranger William Ross and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra in London.</p>
